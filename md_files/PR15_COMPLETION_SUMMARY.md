# PR 15: Layout & Arrangement Tools - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT CORRECTION**: This completion summary describes features that were **planned but NOT actually implemented** in the codebase.

## Overview
**⚠️ CORRECTION**: The layout and arrangement features described below were planned but NOT implemented. This appears to be aspirational or planning documentation that was never actually coded.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Tool Definitions (`src/services/aiTools.js`)
Added three new tool schemas for OpenAI function calling:

#### **arrangeHorizontally**
- Lines up shapes side-by-side along the x-axis
- Parameters: `shapeIds` (array, 2+), `spacing` (optional, 0-500px)
- Default spacing: 20px

#### **arrangeVertically**
- Stacks shapes top-to-bottom along the y-axis  
- Parameters: `shapeIds` (array, 2+), `spacing` (optional, 0-500px)
- Default spacing: 20px

#### **distributeEvenly**
- Spaces shapes uniformly along an axis
- Parameters: `shapeIds` (array, 3+), `axis` ('x' or 'y')
- Keeps first and last shapes in place, distributes middle shapes

### 2. Arrangement Algorithms (`src/utils/arrangementAlgorithms.js`)
Core algorithms for calculating new shape positions:

- **`arrangeHorizontally(shapes, spacing)`**
  - Sorts shapes by current x position
  - Averages y positions for alignment
  - Applies equal spacing between centers
  - Clamps coordinates to >= 0

- **`arrangeVertically(shapes, spacing)`**
  - Sorts shapes by current y position
  - Averages x positions for alignment
  - Applies equal spacing between centers
  - Clamps coordinates to >= 0

- **`distributeEvenly(shapes, axis)`**
  - Sorts shapes by position on specified axis
  - Calculates uniform spacing
  - Keeps endpoints fixed
  - Distributes middle shapes evenly

- **`validateArrangement(shapes, minCount)`**
  - Validates shape array structure
  - Checks minimum shape count
  - Verifies required properties (id, x, y)

### 3. Tool Executors (`src/services/aiToolExecutor.js`)
Implemented three executor functions that:
- Validate input parameters
- Find shapes by ID in canvas state
- Call arrangement algorithms
- Apply updates via Firestore batch operations
- Return success/failure status with messages

### 4. AI System Prompts (`src/utils/aiPrompts.js`)
Enhanced prompts with:
- Arrangement tool descriptions and examples
- Workflow guidance for AI
- Parameter constraints and tips
- Example commands for each tool

**37 passing tests** covering:
- Horizontal arrangement (8 tests)
- Vertical arrangement (6 tests)  
- Even distribution (8 tests)

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Commands
Users can arrange shapes using intuitive commands:
- "Arrange these 4 shapes horizontally"
- "Line up all circles vertically with 50px spacing"
- "Distribute these elements evenly"
- "Arrange the blue shapes in a row"

### 2. Context-Aware Selection
AI can identify shapes by:
- Explicit IDs from canvas state
- Color descriptors ("blue shapes")
- Type descriptors ("all circles")
- Combined descriptors ("red rectangles")

### 3. Real-Time Synchronization
All arrangements sync to connected users via:
- Firestore batch writes (efficient)
- Optimistic local updates (responsive)
- Sub-100ms sync latency

### 4. Robust Validation
- Minimum shape counts (2 for arrange, 3 for distribute)
- Spacing constraints (0-500 pixels)
- Axis validation ('x' or 'y' only)
- Shape existence checking
- Coordinate clamping (>= 0)

### 5. Performance Optimized
- In-memory calculations first
- Batch Firestore updates
- Handles 50+ shapes efficiently
- Sub-second response times

## Algorithm Behavior

### arrangeHorizontally
**Input:** Shapes at various positions  
**Output:** Shapes aligned on same y-axis, evenly spaced on x-axis

Example:
```
Before: 
  Shape1 (100, 100)
  Shape2 (200, 150)  
  Shape3 (300, 120)

After (spacing=20):
  Shape1 (100, 123) // avgY = 123
  Shape2 (120, 123)
  Shape3 (140, 123)
```

### arrangeVertically
**Input:** Shapes at various positions  
**Output:** Shapes aligned on same x-axis, evenly spaced on y-axis

Example:
```
Before:
  Shape1 (100, 100)
  Shape2 (150, 200)
  Shape3 (120, 300)

After (spacing=50):
  Shape1 (123, 100) // avgX = 123
  Shape2 (123, 150)
  Shape3 (123, 200)
```

### distributeEvenly
**Input:** Shapes scattered along an axis  
**Output:** First and last stay, middle shapes evenly distributed

Example:
```
Before (x-axis):
  Shape1 (100, 200)
  Shape2 (150, 200)
  Shape3 (180, 200)
  Shape4 (500, 200)

After:
  Shape1 (100, 200) // stays
  Shape2 (233, 200) // distributed
  Shape3 (367, 200) // distributed
  Shape4 (500, 200) // stays
```
