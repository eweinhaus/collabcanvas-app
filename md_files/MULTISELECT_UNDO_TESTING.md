# Multi-Select Undo/Redo - Quick Testing Guide

**How to test the fix:**

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. **Create 3 rectangles** on the canvas
2. **Multi-select all 3** (Shift+Click each one, or drag a selection box)
3. **Resize them together** by dragging a corner handle
4. **Press Cmd+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Z (Windows)**
5. ✅ **Expected**: All 3 rectangles return to their original size
6. **Press Cmd+Shift+Z (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+Z (Windows)**
7. ✅ **Expected**: All 3 rectangles resize again

## All Fixed Operations

The following operations now support proper multi-select undo/redo:

### 1. Resize (Transformer)
- Multi-select shapes → Drag corner handle → **Cmd+Z** undoes ALL

### 2. Rotate (Transformer)  
- Multi-select shapes → Drag rotation handle → **Cmd+Z** undoes ALL

### 3. Arrow Key Movement
- Multi-select shapes → Press arrow keys → **Cmd+Z** undoes ALL

### 4. Delete
- Multi-select shapes → Press Delete → **Cmd+Z** restores ALL

### 5. Paste
- Copy 3+ shapes → Paste → **Cmd+Z** removes ALL pasted shapes

### 6. Duplicate
- Multi-select shapes → **Cmd+D** → **Cmd+Z** removes ALL duplicates

## What Changed?

**Before**: `Cmd+Z` only undid one shape in a multi-select operation  
**After**: `Cmd+Z` undoes ALL shapes involved in the multi-select operation

## Technical Implementation

Created `BatchCommand` class that groups multiple commands together so they execute/undo as a single unit. When you multi-select and perform an operation:

1. A `BatchCommand` is created
2. Individual commands for each shape are added to the batch
3. The entire batch is executed as one command
4. **Cmd+Z** undoes the entire batch (all shapes)
5. **Cmd+Shift+Z** redoes the entire batch (all shapes)

## Files Changed

- ✅ Created: `src/utils/commands/BatchCommand.js`
- ✅ Updated: `src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx` (6 multi-select operations)
- ✅ Updated: `src/utils/commands/index.js` (export BatchCommand)
- ✅ Created: `src/utils/commands/__tests__/BatchCommand.test.js` (15 tests, all passing)

## Test Results

```
✓ 15 BatchCommand tests passing
✓ No linter errors
✓ No breaking changes to existing functionality
```

## Single-Shape Operations

Single-shape operations are **unchanged** and still work exactly as before. The fix only affects multi-select operations (2+ shapes).
