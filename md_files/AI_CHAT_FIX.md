# AI Chat Fix: Tool Execution Loop

## Problem
The AI chat was frequently returning "✓ Retrieved canvas state" but not completing manipulation commands like "Rotate the square by 45 degrees". The AI would call `getCanvasState` but then stop without executing the actual manipulation operation.

### Example of the Issue
```
User: "Create a blue circle"
AI: ✓ Shape created successfully!  ✅ Works

User: "Create a red square"
AI: ✓ Shape created successfully!  ✅ Works

User: "Rotate the square by 45 degrees"
AI: ✓ Retrieved canvas state.  ❌ Stops here, doesn't rotate
```

## Root Cause
The problem was in the tool execution workflow:
1. User sends command like "Rotate the square by 45 degrees"
2. AI decides it needs canvas state to identify "the square"
3. AI calls `getCanvasState` tool
4. Tool executes successfully
5. Success message shown
6. **AI never gets a chance to use that canvas state to complete the rotation**

The issue is that the AI needs to see the results of `getCanvasState` before it can decide which shape to manipulate, but the current single-turn execution model doesn't support this.

## Solution
Implemented a **multi-turn tool execution loop** with three components:

### 1. Tool Execution Loop (AIContext.jsx)
When the AI calls only `getCanvasState` without any manipulation tools:
- Detect this scenario automatically
- Execute `getCanvasState` and capture the results
- Show "Analyzing shapes..." working message
- Make a **follow-up API call** with the canvas state as tool result
- Let the AI use that information to decide the next action
- Execute the follow-up tool calls (e.g., `rotateShape`)
- Show the final success message

**Code Location**: `src/context/AIContext.jsx` lines 286-405

```javascript
// Check if only getCanvasState was called
if (success && hasGetCanvasState && !hasManipulation && toolCalls.length === 1) {
  // Get canvas state results
  const canvasState = executor.executeGetCanvasState();
  
  // Create tool result message
  const toolResultMessage = createToolMessage(getCanvasStateCall.id, canvasState);
  
  // Make follow-up API call with the results
  const followUpResponse = await postChat([
    systemPrompt,
    ...recentMessages,
    userMessage,
    assistantMessage,
    toolResultMessage,
  ], { tools, toolChoice: 'auto' });
  
  // Execute the follow-up tool calls
  if (followUpToolCalls) {
    await executeToolCalls(followUpToolCalls, followUpAssistantMessage);
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved System Prompt (aiPrompts.js)
Updated the system prompt to discourage unnecessary `getCanvasState` calls:

**Before**:
```
For Moving/Manipulating Shapes:
1. If target unclear: call getCanvasState FIRST to find shapes
2. THEN call manipulation tool (moveShape/rotateShape) with descriptor
```

**After**:
```
For Moving/Manipulating Shapes:
**IMPORTANT**: Complete manipulation commands directly WITHOUT calling getCanvasState first!
- Use descriptors: "blue rectangle", "red circle", "the triangle"
- Most recent shape: "the square" (without color) = most recently created

Example: "Rotate the square by 45 degrees" → rotateShape({descriptor:"square", rotation:45})
```

**Code Location**: `src/utils/aiPrompts.js` lines 63-71

### 3. Updated Tool Descriptions (aiTools.js)
Made `getCanvasState` tool description more specific about when to use it:

**Before**:
```
Get current state of all shapes on the canvas. Use this to understand what exists before making changes.
```

**After**:
```
Get current state of all shapes on the canvas. ONLY use this for informational queries like "what shapes are on the canvas?" or "list all shapes". For manipulation commands (move/rotate/delete), use the descriptor directly WITHOUT calling getCanvasState first.
```

**Code Location**: `src/services/aiTools.js` lines 60-71

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: AI Tries Direct Manipulation (Preferred)
```
User: "Rotate the square by 45 degrees"
  ↓
AI: rotateShape({descriptor:"square", rotation:45})
  ↓
Shape rotated ✓
  ↓
AI: "✓ Shape rotated successfully!"
```

### Scenario 2: AI Calls getCanvasState (Fallback)
```
User: "Move the blue thing to the right"
  ↓
AI: getCanvasState()
  ↓
Tool Execution Loop detects single getCanvasState call
  ↓
Execute getCanvasState, get results: [{id:1, type:"rectangle", fill:"#0000FF", x:200, y:200}]
  ↓
Show "Analyzing shapes..." message
  ↓
Make follow-up API call with canvas state results
  ↓
AI: moveShape({descriptor:"blue rectangle", x:400, y:200})
  ↓
Shape moved ✓
  ↓
AI: "✓ Shape moved successfully!"
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
All core AI tests passing:
- ✅ `src/services/__tests__/aiToolExecutor.test.js` - All passing
- ✅ `src/utils/__tests__/batchCreate.test.js` - All passing
- ✅ `src/utils/__tests__/alignment.test.js` - All passing

### Manual Testing
Test these scenarios:

1. **Direct creation** (should work as before):
   - "Create a blue circle"
   - "Create a red square at 500, 500"

2. **Direct manipulation** (should work better now):
   - "Rotate the square by 45 degrees"
   - "Move the blue circle to 600, 300"
   - "Rotate the red rectangle 90 degrees"

3. **Ambiguous commands** (should use fallback):
   - "Move the shape to the right" (if multiple shapes exist)
   - "Rotate the thing by 30 degrees" (should try to identify via getCanvasState)

4. **Informational queries** (should still use getCanvasState):
   - "What shapes are on the canvas?"
   - "List all shapes"
   - "Show me what's on the canvas"

## Impact

### Performance
- **Direct manipulation**: Same as before (1 API call)
- **Fallback with getCanvasState**: 2 API calls (still fast, ~2-3 seconds total)

### Cost
- **Direct manipulation**: Same cost as before (~$0.002 per command)
- **Fallback**: Double the cost (~$0.004 per command) but only when necessary

### User Experience
- ✅ Manipulation commands now complete successfully
- ✅ No more "Retrieved canvas state" with no action
- ✅ Working messages show progress ("Analyzing shapes...")
- ✅ Clear success messages after completion

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Multiple shapes**: AI uses descriptor to identify target shape
2. **Ambiguous descriptors**: AI uses recency (most recently created shape)
3. **Follow-up API fails**: Shows fallback message "✓ Retrieved canvas state."
4. **User cancels during follow-up**: Abort controller propagates to follow-up call
5. **No shapes on canvas**: AI returns error "Canvas is empty"

## Files Modified
1. `src/context/AIContext.jsx` - Added tool execution loop
2. `src/utils/aiPrompts.js` - Updated system prompt for manipulation commands
3. `src/services/aiTools.js` - Clarified getCanvasState tool description

## Related Issues
- Fixes the issue reported where "Rotate te square by 45 degrees" only showed "Retrieved canvas state"
- Should also fix similar issues with move, delete, and color change commands

## Future Improvements
1. **Proactive shape caching**: Send recent shapes with every request to avoid getCanvasState calls
2. **Descriptor parsing**: Improve shape identification to handle more ambiguous descriptors
3. **Multi-step workflows**: Support more complex multi-tool sequences (e.g., "create a grid and rotate all of them")
