# Canvas.jsx Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored Canvas.jsx by extracting keyboard shortcuts and shape transform logic into custom hooks, reducing component complexity by 37%.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `useShapeTransform.js` Hook (152 lines)
**Location**: `src/hooks/useShapeTransform.js`

**Responsibilities**:
- Manages transform start/end state
- Handles single and multi-shape transformations
- Creates undo/redo commands for transforms
- Resets Konva node scales after transform

**API**:
```javascript
const { handleTransformStart, handleTransformEnd } = useShapeTransform({
  selectedIds,
  shapes,
  transformerRef,
  firestoreActions,
  commandActions,
});
```

### 2. Created `useCanvasKeyboardShortcuts.js` Hook (415 lines)
**Location**: `src/hooks/useCanvasKeyboardShortcuts.js`

**Responsibilities**:
- Handles all keyboard shortcuts (undo, redo, copy, paste, delete, etc.)
- Arrow key movement with 5px/20px step
- Z-index shortcuts (bring to front, send to back, etc.)
- Alignment shortcuts (align left/right/top/bottom, distribute, etc.)
- Pan mode activation (H key)
- Escape key to clear selection

**API**:
```javascript
useCanvasKeyboardShortcuts({
  editingTextId,
  selectedIds,
  shapes,
  clipboard,
  setClipboard,
  actions,
  firestoreActions,
  commandActions,
  handleAlign,
  setShowShortcuts,
  setContextMenu,
});
```

### 3. Updated Canvas.jsx
**Changes**:
- ✅ Added imports for the two new hooks
- ✅ Removed `transformStartStateRef` (now internal to hook)
- ✅ Removed `handleTransformStart` callback (~25 lines)
- ✅ Removed `handleTransformEnd` callback (~100 lines)
- ✅ Removed keyboard shortcuts `useEffect` (~360 lines)
- ✅ Removed unused alignment imports (moved to keyboard shortcuts hook)
- ✅ Added hook calls to replace removed logic

## Results

### File Size Reduction
| File | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| Canvas.jsx | 1,304 lines | 826 lines | **-478 lines (-37%)** |
| New hooks | 0 lines | 567 lines | +567 lines |
| **Total** | **1,304 lines** | **1,393 lines** | **+89 lines** |

### Benefits
1. **Improved Readability**: Canvas.jsx is now 37% smaller and easier to understand
2. **Better Organization**: Related logic is grouped together in dedicated hooks
3. **Reusability**: Hooks can be tested independently and reused if needed
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify keyboard shortcuts or transform logic in isolation
5. **Testability**: Each hook can be tested independently with focused unit tests

## Testing
- ✅ No linting errors in any modified files
- ✅ Canvas-related tests passing (26 tests)
- ✅ No functionality changes - pure refactoring
- ⚠️ Pre-existing test failures in `performanceMonitor.test.js` and `throttle.enhanced.test.js` (unrelated to this refactoring)

## Functionality Preserved
All functionality remains exactly the same:
- ✅ Undo/Redo (Cmd/Ctrl+Z)
- ✅ Copy/Paste (Cmd/Ctrl+C/V)
- ✅ Duplicate (Cmd/Ctrl+D)
- ✅ Delete (Delete/Backspace)
- ✅ Arrow key movement
- ✅ Z-index shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+[/])
- ✅ Alignment shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+L/R/T/B/M/H/V)
- ✅ Pan mode (H key)
- ✅ Escape to clear selection
- ✅ Shape transform with undo/redo support

## Next Steps (Optional)
Further refactoring opportunities identified but not implemented:
1. `useSelectionBox` (~80 lines)
2. `useTextEditing` (~60 lines)
3. `useEditIndicators` (~90 lines)
4. `useAlignmentToolbarPosition` (~40 lines)
5. `useColorPicker` (~25 lines)

Total potential additional reduction: ~295 lines from Canvas.jsx

## Notes
- This refactoring follows React best practices for custom hooks
- All extracted logic maintains the same dependencies and behavior
- No breaking changes to the component API
- Memory bank should be updated to reflect this refactoring pattern
