## Test Suite

### Test 12.36: Create Comment & Verify Firestore Write
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Steps:**
1. User A creates a rectangle on the canvas
2. User A selects the rectangle and presses `Cmd+Shift+C` (or `Ctrl+Shift+C` on Windows/Linux)
3. User A types "Test comment" in the input field
4. User A clicks "Add Comment" button
5. Open Firebase Console → Firestore → boards → [boardId] → shapes → [shapeId] → comments
6. Verify the comment document exists with all required fields

**Expected Result:**
- Comment appears in the thread panel
- Comment badge (💬 1) appears at top-right corner of shape
- Firestore document contains: `id`, `text`, `authorId`, `authorName`, `authorEmail`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `edited`
- Toast notification: "Comment added"

### Test 12.37: Real-time Comment Sync to Multiple Users
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Steps:**
1. User A and User B both viewing the same canvas
2. User A creates a circle
3. User A adds comment "Circle comment" via keyboard shortcut
4. Observe User B's screen

**Expected Result:**
- User B sees the comment badge appear on the circle instantly (<500ms)
- User B can click the badge and see the comment in real-time
- No page refresh required
- Comment count is accurate

---

### Test 12.38: Edit/Delete Permissions
**Status:** ✅ PASSED (Modified - All users can edit/delete)

**Steps:**
1. User A creates a triangle and adds comment "Original comment"
2. User B opens the comment thread for that triangle
3. User B clicks the edit icon on User A's comment
4. User B changes text to "Edited by User B"
5. User B saves the edit
6. User B clicks delete icon
7. User B confirms deletion

**Expected Result:**
- User B can successfully edit User A's comment
- Comment shows "edited" indicator
- User A sees the edit in real-time
- User B can successfully delete User A's comment
- Comment disappears for both users in real-time
- Badge updates to show correct count (or disappears if 0 comments)

**Note:** Original design was author-only permissions, but changed to allow all authenticated users to edit/delete all comments for better collaboration.

---

### Test 12.39: Instant Visibility for User B
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Steps:**
1. User A creates a rectangle

3. Observe User B's screen immediately

**Expected Result:**
- Comment badge appears on User B's screen within 500ms
- Badge shows count "1"
- Badge positioned at top-right corner of shape
- No manual refresh needed

**Bug Fixed:** Initial implementation required User B to open comments panel before seeing badge. Fixed by adding auto-subscription to all shapes' comments on canvas mount.

1. User A and User B both open comment thread for same shape
2. User A types "Comment from A" and submits

2. User A adds unique comments to each shape (e.g., "Comment 1", "Comment 2", ...)
3. Verify all badges appear correctly
4. User A refreshes the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
5. Wait for page to reload
6. Check all shapes

**Expected Result:**
- All 10 comment badges persist after refresh

**Expected Result:**
- Edit mode activates with current text pre-filled
- Save updates the comment text
- Comment shows "(edited)" indicator
- User B sees the edit in real-time
- Delete removes comment instantly
- Badge count decrements (or badge disappears if last comment)

## Keyboard Shortcuts Testing

### Test: Comment Keyboard Shortcut
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Steps:**
1. Select a shape on canvas
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+C` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows/Linux)
3. Press `?` to open shortcuts modal
4. Verify comment shortcut is listed

**Expected Result:**

## UI/UX Testing

### Test: Comment Badge Positioning
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Steps:**
1. Create shapes of different types (rectangle, circle, triangle, text)
2. Add comments to each shape
3. Pan and zoom the canvas
4. Check badge positions

**Expected Result:**
- Badges positioned at top-right corner of each shape
- Badges remain anchored to shapes during pan/zoom
- Badges have small inward offset (-8px) for better aesthetics
- Badges work correctly for all shape types

**Bug Fixed:** Initial positioning was at bottom-right with larger offset. Changed to top-right with closer positioning.

---

### Test: Comment Thread Panel UX
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Steps:**
1. Open a comment thread with 5+ comments
2. Add a new comment
3. Edit an existing comment
4. Delete a comment
5. Try to add empty comment
6. Try to add 501-character comment
7. Click outside panel or press Esc

**Expected Result:**
- Panel opens from right side with smooth animation
- Comments are listed chronologically (oldest first)
- Scroll works correctly for long threads
- Empty comments are rejected with error message
- Comments >500 characters are rejected with error message
- Panel closes smoothly on Esc or outside click
- Edit box respects parent container (no overflow)

**Bug Fixed:** Edit box was overflowing parent div. Fixed with `max-width: 100%`, `box-sizing: border-box`, and `overflow: hidden` on relevant elements.

---

### Test: Loading States
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Steps:**
1. Open comment thread for a shape with 0 comments
2. Open comment thread for a shape with existing comments
3. Add a comment while thread is open
4. Delete all comments

**Expected Result:**
- "Loading Comments..." shows briefly when opening thread
- Loading state clears when subscription is ready (even for 0 comments)
- "No comments yet" message shows for empty threads
- No infinite "Loading Comments..." state

**Bug Fixed:** Loading state never cleared when shape had 0 comments. Fixed by adding `onReady` callback to subscription that fires after first snapshot.

---

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Test: Network Interruption
**Steps:**
1. Open comment thread
2. Disconnect internet
3. Try to add comment
4. Reconnect internet

**Expected Result:**
- Error toast: "Failed to add comment"
- Comment doesn't appear in UI
- After reconnection, new comments can be added successfully

---

### Test: Shape Deleted While Comment Panel Open
**Steps:**
1. Open comment thread for a shape
2. Have User B delete the shape
3. Try to add comment

**Expected Result:**
- Comment panel remains open
- Comments may fail to add (shape doesn't exist)
- No crashes or errors

**Note:** This edge case is acceptable - comments become inaccessible when shape is deleted. Future enhancement could warn user.

---

### Test: Very Long Comment Text
**Steps:**
1. Attempt to add 500-character comment
2. Attempt to add 501-character comment

**Expected Result:**
- 500 characters: Comment adds successfully
- 501 characters: Error message "Comment must be 500 characters or less"
- Client-side validation prevents submission
- Server-side Firestore rules also enforce limit

---

### Test: Special Characters & Formatting
**Steps:**
1. Add comment with emoji: "Great work! 🎉"
2. Add comment with newlines: "Line 1\nLine 2\nLine 3"
3. Add comment with special chars: "Test: < > & \" '"

**Expected Result:**
- All characters display correctly
- Newlines preserved in display (using `white-space: pre-wrap`)
- No XSS vulnerabilities (React escapes by default)
- No rendering issues

---

## Performance Testing

### Test: Many Comments on Single Shape
