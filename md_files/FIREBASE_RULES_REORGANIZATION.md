## ⚠️ Important Notes

### When Editing Rules:
1. **Edit** files in `md_files/firebase_rules/` directory (NOT Firebase Console directly)
2. **Test** using Firebase Console simulator
3. **Deploy** to Firebase Console
4. **Verify** in browser (no PERMISSION_DENIED errors)
5. **Commit** to git with descriptive message

### Version Control:
```bash
# When you update rules:
git add collabcanvas-app/md_files/firebase_rules/
git commit -m "Update Firebase rules: [describe change]"
git push
```

## 🔐 Current Rules Summary

### Realtime Database (`database.rules.json`)
- **Cursors**: Auth required, users write only their own
- **Presence**: Same as cursors (ready for future feature)
- **Board-level**: Auth users can read

### Firestore (`firestore.rules`)
- **Shapes**: Auth required for all operations
- **Create**: Must set `createdBy` to own UID
- **Update/Delete**: Any authenticated user (collaboration)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Verify** current rules are synced in Firebase Console
2. **Test** app functionality (cursors, shapes)
3. **Bookmark** `md_files/firebase_rules/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for future use
4. **Remember** to edit rules in `md_files/firebase_rules/` directory only
