# Firebase Rules Documentation - Setup Complete

## ‚úÖ What Was Created

### 1. **Cursor Rule in `.cursor/rules/`**
**File**: `.cursor/rules/firebase-rules.mdc`
- Documents how to update Firebase rules from codebase
- Provides step-by-step instructions for both RTDB and Firestore
- Explains security principles and testing procedures

### 2. **Firebase Rules in Codebase**
**Files** (located in `md_files/firebase_rules/` directory):
- `md_files/firebase_rules/database.rules.json` - Realtime Database rules
- `md_files/firebase_rules/firestore.rules` - Firestore rules
- `md_files/firebase_rules/README.md` - Quick reference

These files are the **source of truth** - always sync these to Firebase Console.

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
**File**: `collabcanvas-app/md_files/FIREBASE_RULES_GUIDE.md`
- Complete explanation of all rules
- Security principles
- Common errors and fixes
- Testing procedures
- Future enhancements
- Pre-deployment checklist

## üìã Current Rules Status

### Realtime Database (Cursors & Presence)
‚úÖ **Synced to Firebase Console**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "boards": {
      "$boardId": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        "cursors": {
          "$uid": {
            ".read": "auth != null",
            ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Firestore (Shapes)
‚úÖ **Synced to Firebase Console**
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /boards/{boardId}/shapes/{shapeId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null 
                    && request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
      allow delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Workflow for Future Rule Changes

### When You Need to Update Rules:

1. **Edit the codebase files** in `md_files/firebase_rules/` directory:
   - `md_files/firebase_rules/database.rules.json` for Realtime Database
   - `md_files/firebase_rules/firestore.rules` for Firestore

2. **Test locally** (optional):
   - Use Firebase Console simulator
   - Or run Firebase emulator

3. **Sync to Firebase Console**:
   - Follow instructions in `.cursor/rules/firebase-rules.mdc`
   - Or see detailed guide in `md_files/FIREBASE_RULES_GUIDE.md`

4. **Verify**:
   - Test in browser
   - Check for PERMISSION_DENIED errors
   - Confirm features work (cursors, shapes sync)

5. **Commit to git**:
   ```bash
   git add collabcanvas-app/md_files/firebase_rules/
   git commit -m "Update Firebase rules: [describe change]"
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Keep codebase rules as source of truth
- ‚úÖ Document rule changes in commit messages
- ‚úÖ Test rules before deploying
- ‚úÖ Sync rules to Firebase Console after changes
- ‚úÖ Version control all rule files

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Edit rules only in Firebase Console (they'll be out of sync)
- ‚ùå Deploy without testing rules
- ‚ùå Forget to publish after editing in Console
- ‚ùå Skip the 10-second wait after RTDB rule changes

## üêõ PR8 Task Added

Added to `tasks.md` ‚Üí **PR 8: Codebase Cleanup**:
- **Task 11.2**: Fix Chrome cursor drag issue - cursor updates only on click, not during drag

**Issue**: In Chrome, cursor position only updates on click, not during canvas drag/pan.

**Investigation needed**: The `onDragMove` handler was added but may need additional work for Chrome's specific drag event handling.

## üìö Documentation Files

1. **`.cursor/rules/firebase-rules.mdc`** - Quick reference for AI assistant
2. **`md_files/firebase_rules/README.md`** - Quick deployment guide
3. **`md_files/FIREBASE_RULES_GUIDE.md`** - Complete human-readable guide
4. **`md_files/firebase_rules/database.rules.json`** - Realtime Database rules (source of truth)
5. **`md_files/firebase_rules/firestore.rules`** - Firestore rules (source of truth)

All documentation is now in place to prevent future Firebase permission issues!

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **For Chrome cursor issue** (PR8 Task 11.2):
   - Test different Chrome versions
   - Check if `onDragMove` fires during drag
   - Consider alternative event handlers
   - May need to use native drag events

2. **For PR4 completion**:
   - Tasks 6.1-6.11 are complete ‚úÖ
   - Ready to move on to tasks 7.1-7.9 (Presence features)
   - Or continue to PR5 (Robustness)
