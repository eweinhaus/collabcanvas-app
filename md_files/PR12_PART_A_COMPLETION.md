## Firestore Data Structure

### Collection Path
```
boards/{boardId}/shapes/{shapeId}/comments/{commentId}
```

### Document Schema
```javascript
{
  id: string,              // Auto-generated comment ID
  text: string,            // Comment text (1-500 chars)
  authorId: string,        // Firebase Auth UID
  authorName: string,      // Display name or email prefix

  - CommentInput with character counter
  - Edit/delete buttons for own comments

### Part C: Integration & Real-time Sync (1-2 hours)
- [ ] **12.26-12.35**: Wire up UI to backend
  - Add indicators to shapes
  - Create CommentsContext
  - Implement real-time updates
  - Add keyboard shortcuts

### Testing & Documentation

  - Integration tests
  - Manual testing guide
  - Update README
  - Update memory bank

---

## Manual Testing Instructions

Once UI components are built in Part B/C, test these scenarios:

1. **Create Comment**
   - User A adds comment to shape
   - Verify appears in Firestore console
   - User B sees comment in <500ms

2. **Edit Comment**
   - User A edits own comment
   - User B sees "edited" indicator
   - User B cannot edit User A's comment

3. **Delete Comment**
   - User A deletes own comment
   - User B sees removal in real-time
   - User B cannot delete User A's comment

4. **Validation**
   - Try empty comment → blocked
   - Try 501 char comment → blocked
   - Try comment while signed out → blocked

---

## Deployment Notes

1. **Firestore Rules**: Deploy updated rules before using in production
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Testing in Dev**: Use Firebase emulators for testing
   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start
   ```

3. **Indexes**: Comments are ordered by `createdAt`. Firestore may auto-create index on first query. Check console for index creation links.

---

## Technical Decisions

1. **Hard Delete vs Soft Delete**: Chose hard delete for comments (unlike shapes which use soft delete). Comments are smaller and less critical to preserve.

2. **Subcollection**: Comments are stored as subcollections under shapes for better organization and security rules isolation.

3. **Character Limit**: 500 characters strikes balance between useful feedback and preventing abuse.

4. **Author Verification**: Implemented both client-side (for UX) and server-side (for security) authorization checks.

5. **Real-time Updates**: Used `onSnapshot` with change detection for efficient real-time sync.
