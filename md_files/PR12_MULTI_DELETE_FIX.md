# PR12: Multiple Shape Operations & Color Filtering Fix

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** "Delete all blue triangles" deleted ALL triangles (not just blue ones)  
**Solution:** Enhanced color matching logic and multi-operation support  

---

## The Problem

**Command:** "Delete all blue triangles"

**Expected:**
- Delete only triangles that are blue (any shade of blue)
- Keep non-blue triangles (red, green, yellow, etc.)

**What Happened:**
- ‚ùå Deleted ALL triangles regardless of color
- ‚ùå Blue, red, green triangles all deleted

**Root Causes:**
1. AI wasn't filtering by color properly (only by type)
2. No clear instructions on color matching with hex values
3. No guidance on handling "all X" commands

---

## The Solution

### 1. Enhanced Color Matching Instructions

**File:** `src/utils/aiPrompts.js`

Added explicit color matching rules:
```
**Color Matching:**
Colors in canvas state are hex codes (e.g., "#0000ff"). When user says a color name:
- "blue" matches shades like #0000ff, #0066ff, #3366ff, #4169e1, #1e90ff, etc.
  (R < 100, G < 200, B > 150)
- "red" matches shades like #ff0000, #ff3333, #e74c3c, #dc143c, etc.
  (R > 150, G < 100, B < 100)
- "green" matches shades like #00ff00, #008000, #2ecc71, #27ae60, etc.
  (R < 100, G > 150, B < 100)

When filtering by color, check if the hex value matches the general color family,
not exact match.
```

**Why This Works:**
- AI now knows colors are hex codes
- AI knows how to identify color families (blue vs red vs green)
- AI can handle various shades (light blue, dark blue, navy, etc.)

### 2. Multiple Operations Support

Added instructions for "all X" commands:
```
**Multiple Operations:**
When user says "all X", you can make MULTIPLE tool calls in ONE response:
- "Delete all blue triangles" ‚Üí Call deleteShape multiple times (once per blue triangle)
- "Move all circles to 500, 300" ‚Üí Call moveShape multiple times (once per circle)
```

**How It Works:**
- OpenAI function calling supports multiple tool_calls in one response
- AI can call deleteShape 5 times if there are 5 blue triangles
- All operations execute in one conversation round

### 3. Improved Toast Messages

**File:** `src/context/AIContext.jsx`

Added smart toast summary:
```javascript
if (actionResults.length === 1) {
  // Single action - show specific message
  toast.success(result.message, 2000);
} else {
  // Multiple actions - show summary
  toast.success(`‚úÖ Successfully executed ${successCount} action(s)`, 3000);
}
```

**User Experience:**
- Single action: "Deleted circle" ‚úÖ
- Multiple actions: "‚úÖ Successfully executed 5 action(s)" ‚úÖ
- Mixed results: "‚ö†Ô∏è 3 succeeded, 2 failed"

---

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Delete All Blue Triangles

**Setup:**
- Canvas has 10 triangles:
  - 3 blue triangles (#0000ff, #3366ff, #1e90ff)
  - 4 red triangles (#ff0000, #e74c3c, etc.)
  - 3 green triangles (#00ff00, #2ecc71, etc.)

**User Command:** "Delete all blue triangles"

**AI Workflow:**
1. **Round 1:** Call `getCanvasState()`
   - Returns all 10 triangles with hex colors

2. **Round 2:** Analyze canvas state
   - Filter by type: `shape.type === 'triangle'` ‚Üí 10 triangles
   - Filter by color: Check if hex is blue family
     - #0000ff ‚Üí R=0, G=0, B=255 ‚Üí Blue ‚úÖ
     - #3366ff ‚Üí R=51, G=102, B=255 ‚Üí Blue ‚úÖ
     - #1e90ff ‚Üí R=30, G=144, B=255 ‚Üí Blue ‚úÖ
     - #ff0000 ‚Üí R=255, G=0, B=0 ‚Üí Red ‚ùå
     - (etc.)
   - Result: 3 blue triangles identified

3. **Execute:** Make 3 deleteShape calls in one response
   ```json
   {
     "tool_calls": [
       {"function": {"name": "deleteShape", "arguments": {"id": "tri-1"}}},
       {"function": {"name": "deleteShape", "arguments": {"id": "tri-2"}}},
       {"function": {"name": "deleteShape", "arguments": {"id": "tri-3"}}}
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Result:** 
   - ‚úÖ 3 blue triangles deleted
   - ‚úÖ 7 other triangles remain
   - ‚úÖ Toast: "Successfully executed 3 action(s)"

### Scenario 2: Delete Specific Shape

**User Command:** "Delete the triangle"

**AI Workflow:**
1. Get canvas state
2. Filter by type: `shape.type === 'triangle'`
3. Select most recent triangle (first in sorted list)
4. Call `deleteShape(id)` once
5. Toast: "Deleted triangle" (specific message)

### Scenario 3: Move All Red Circles

**User Command:** "Move all red circles to 600, 400"

**AI Workflow:**
1. Get canvas state
2. Filter by type AND color:
   - `shape.type === 'circle'`
   - Hex color matches red family (R > 150, G < 100, B < 100)
3. Call `moveShape(id, 600, 400)` for each red circle
4. Toast: "‚úÖ Successfully executed X action(s)"

## Color Matching Examples

### Blue Color Family
```
User says: "blue"
Matches:
‚úÖ #0000ff (pure blue)
‚úÖ #0066ff (bright blue)
‚úÖ #3366ff (medium blue)
‚úÖ #4169e1 (royal blue)
‚úÖ #1e90ff (dodger blue)
‚úÖ #87ceeb (sky blue)

Doesn't match:
‚ùå #ff0000 (red)
‚ùå #00ff00 (green)
‚ùå #800080 (purple - has too much red)
```

### Red Color Family
```
User says: "red"
Matches:
‚úÖ #ff0000 (pure red)
‚úÖ #ff3333 (light red)
‚úÖ #e74c3c (tomato red)
‚úÖ #dc143c (crimson)

Doesn't match:
‚ùå #0000ff (blue)
‚ùå #ff69b4 (hot pink - too much blue)
```

### Green Color Family
```
User says: "green"
Matches:
‚úÖ #00ff00 (pure green)
‚úÖ #008000 (dark green)
‚úÖ #2ecc71 (emerald)
‚úÖ #27ae60 (nephritis)

Doesn't match:
‚ùå #0000ff (blue)
‚ùå #00ffff (cyan - too much blue)
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Test 1: Mixed Colors
```
Setup: 5 blue triangles, 5 red triangles
Command: "Delete all blue triangles"

Expected:
‚úÖ 5 blue triangles deleted
‚úÖ 5 red triangles remain
‚úÖ Toast: "‚úÖ Successfully executed 5 action(s)"
```

### Test 2: Shades of Blue
```
Setup: 
- Triangle #1: #0000ff (pure blue)
- Triangle #2: #3366ff (medium blue)
- Triangle #3: #87ceeb (sky blue)
- Triangle #4: #ff0000 (red)

Command: "Delete all blue triangles"

Expected:
‚úÖ Triangles #1, #2, #3 deleted (all blue shades)
‚úÖ Triangle #4 remains (red, not blue)
‚úÖ Toast: "‚úÖ Successfully executed 3 action(s)"
```

### Test 3: No Matches
```
Setup: 5 red triangles, 5 green triangles
Command: "Delete all blue triangles"

Expected:
‚úÖ No triangles deleted (none are blue)
‚úÖ All 10 triangles remain
‚úÖ Toast: "No blue triangles found" (AI response)
```

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made

**1. System Prompt Updates** (`aiPrompts.js`)
- Added **Color Matching** section with RGB rules
- Added **Multiple Operations** section
- Updated workflow to filter by ALL criteria (not just first match)

**2. Toast Message Logic** (`AIContext.jsx`)
- Suppress individual toasts during multi-operation
- Show summary toast at end
- Handle success/failure counts
- Special handling for single vs multiple operations

### Code Flow

```javascript
// User: "Delete all blue triangles"

// Round 1: Get state
getCanvasState() ‚Üí {shapes: [10 triangles with colors]}

// Round 2: AI processes
AI filters:
  shapes
    .filter(s => s.type === 'triangle')
    .filter(s => isBlue(s.color))  // RGB check
  ‚Üí [tri-1, tri-2, tri-3]

AI generates multiple tool calls:
  [deleteShape(tri-1), deleteShape(tri-2), deleteShape(tri-3)]

// Execution
executeDeleteShape(tri-1) ‚Üí success
executeDeleteShape(tri-2) ‚Üí success  
executeDeleteShape(tri-3) ‚Üí success

// Summary Toast
toast.success("‚úÖ Successfully executed 3 action(s)")
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. No Matching Shapes
```
Command: "Delete all purple hexagons"
Result: AI responds "No purple hexagons found"
```

### 2. Ambiguous Colors
```
Command: "Delete all dark blue triangles"
Result: AI interprets "dark blue" as blue family, deletes all blue triangles
```

### 3. Partial Failures
```
Scenario: 5 shapes to delete, 3 succeed, 2 fail (network error)
Toast: "‚ö†Ô∏è 3 succeeded, 2 failed"
```

### 4. Single Shape Match
```
Command: "Delete all blue triangles" (only 1 exists)
Toast: "Deleted triangle" (specific message, not "executed 1 action")
```

---

## Future Improvements

### 1. More Precise Color Matching
```javascript
// Could implement HSL color space matching:
function isBlue(hex) {
  const hsl = hexToHSL(hex);
  return hsl.hue >= 200 && hsl.hue <= 260; // Blue hue range
}
```

### 2. Color Range Queries
```
"Delete all light blue triangles"
"Delete all dark red circles"
```

### 3. Complex Filters
```
"Delete all shapes except blue circles"
"Move large red rectangles to 500, 300"
```

### 4. Visual Confirmation
```
Before deletion:
- Highlight shapes that will be affected
- Show count: "About to delete 5 shapes"
- User confirms or cancels
```
