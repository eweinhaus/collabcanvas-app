# Realtime Cursor Fix - Summary

## Issue Identified
The realtime cursor feature was not working due to a critical bug in the code that prevented cursor data from being properly cleaned up and managed.

## How Realtime Cursors Should Work

### Architecture Overview
```
User Mouse Movement → Canvas Component → useRealtimeCursor Hook → CanvasContext
    → realtimeCursorService → Firebase Realtime Database → All Connected Clients
```

### Data Flow

1. **Publishing Your Cursor**
   - When you move mouse on canvas → `handlePointerMove` fires
   - Converts screen coordinates to canvas coordinates
   - Calls `publishLocalCursor({ x, y, scaleOverride: scale })`
   - Hook adds user info (uid, name, color) to payload
   - Throttled (50ms) to avoid flooding Firebase
   - Writes to: `boards/default/cursors/{your-uid}`

2. **Receiving Other Cursors**
   - On component mount, subscribes to: `boards/default/cursors/*`
   - Excludes your own cursor (via `excludeUid`)
   - Firebase sends real-time updates when any cursor changes
   - Updates `remoteCursors` state array
   - Canvas renders each cursor as a colored circle with label

3. **Cleanup**
   - When you leave page → removes your cursor
   - When you disconnect → Firebase auto-removes your cursor
   - Other users see your cursor disappear

## Critical Bug Fixed

### The Problem
In `CanvasContext.jsx` line 309, the cursor object referenced `removeCursor` directly:
```javascript
cursor: {
  publishCursor,
  startCursorSubscription,
  stopCursorSubscription,
  setupCursorDisconnect,
  removeCursor,  // ❌ This was not defined as a callback!
}
```

The `removeCursor` function was imported from the service but never wrapped in a `useCallback`. This meant:
- The function reference was undefined
- Cleanup on unmount failed silently
- Cursors weren't removed when users left
- State became inconsistent

### The Fix
Created a proper callback wrapper:
```javascript
const removeCursorCallback = useCallback(({ uid, boardId = DEFAULT_BOARD_ID }) => {
  if (!uid) {
    console.warn('[CanvasContext] removeCursor called without uid');
    return Promise.resolve();
  }
  console.log('[CanvasContext] Removing cursor:', { uid, boardId });
  return removeCursor({ uid, boardId }).catch((err) => {
    console.error('[CanvasContext] Failed to remove cursor', err);
  });
}, []);
```

## Other Issues Fixed

1. **Missing boardId in Canvas.jsx**
   - Canvas component now explicitly passes `boardId='default'` to hook
   - Makes data flow clearer and easier to debug

2. **No Logging**
   - Added comprehensive logging at every layer:
     - `[Canvas]` - Component level
     - `[useRealtimeCursor]` - Hook level
     - `[CanvasContext]` - Context level
     - `[realtimeCursorService]` - Service/Firebase level
   - Each layer logs when:
     - Publishing cursor position
     - Receiving cursor updates
     - Subscribing/unsubscribing
     - Setting up disconnect handlers
     - Removing cursors
     - Errors occur

## Files Modified

1. **src/context/CanvasContext.jsx**
   - Added `removeCursorCallback` wrapper
   - Added logging to all cursor functions
   - Fixed `cursor` object to use `removeCursorCallback`

2. **src/hooks/useRealtimeCursor.js**
   - Added logging to `publishLocalCursor`
   - Added logging to `clearLocalCursor`
   - Added logging to setup/cleanup useEffect

3. **src/services/realtimeCursorService.js**
   - Added logging to `setCursorPosition`
   - Added logging to `subscribeToCursors`
   - Added logging to `removeCursor`
   - Added logging to `registerDisconnectCleanup`
   - Added error handlers with logging

4. **src/components/canvas/Canvas.jsx**
   - Added `boardId` prop (defaults to 'default')
   - Pass `boardId` to `useRealtimeCursor` hook
   - Added useEffect to log remote cursor updates

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. **Firebase Realtime Database must be enabled**
   - Follow: `md_files/FIREBASE_RTDB_SETUP.md`
   - Ensure `.env` has `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL`
   - Verify security rules are published

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In collabcanvas-app/.env
   VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your-project-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
   # Plus all other Firebase config vars
   ```

### Testing Steps

1. **Start the app**
   ```bash
   cd collabcanvas-app
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Browser Console**
   - Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Clear console for clean view

3. **Sign in**
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Grant permissions
   - Should see logs:
     ```
     [useRealtimeCursor] Setting up cursor for user: abc123 boardId: default
     [CanvasContext] Setting up cursor disconnect cleanup: {uid: "abc123", boardId: "default"}
     [realtimeCursorService] Registering disconnect cleanup: {uid: "abc123", boardId: "default"}
     [CanvasContext] Starting cursor subscription: {boardId: "default", uid: "abc123"}
     [realtimeCursorService] Subscribing to cursors: {boardId: "default", excludeUid: "abc123"}
     ```

4. **Move your mouse on canvas**
   - Should see logs (throttled to 50ms):
     ```
     [useRealtimeCursor] Publishing local cursor: {x: 123.4, y: 567.8, boardId: "default", uid: "abc123"}
     [CanvasContext] Publishing cursor: {uid: "abc123", boardId: "default", x: 123.4, y: 567.8}
     [realtimeCursorService] Setting cursor position: {uid: "abc123", boardId: "default", x: 123.4, y: 567.8}
     ```

5. **Open second browser/incognito window**
   - Navigate to same URL
   - Sign in with DIFFERENT Google account
   - Should see same setup logs

6. **Move mouse in second window**
   - In FIRST window, should see:
     ```
     [realtimeCursorService] Cursor update received: 1 cursors
     [CanvasContext] Received cursor update: 1 cursors
     [Canvas] Remote cursors updated: 1 cursors [{uid: "xyz789", x: 100, y: 200, ...}]
     ```
   - Should see a colored circle with initials appear on canvas

7. **Move mouse in first window**
   - In SECOND window, should see your cursor appear

8. **Leave page**
   - Close one browser window
   - Other window should see:
     ```
     [realtimeCursorService] Cursor update received: 0 cursors
     [Canvas] Remote cursors updated: 0 cursors
     ```
   - Cursor should disappear

### Verifying in Firebase Console

1. Go to Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Data
2. While moving mouse, should see:
   ```
   boards/
     default/
       cursors/
         {user1-uid}/
           uid: "{user1-uid}"
           x: 123.45
           y: 678.90
           scale: 1
           name: "AB"
           color: "#3498db"
           lastActive: {timestamp}
           updatedAt: {timestamp}
         {user2-uid}/
           ...
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### No logs appearing
- **Check**: Are you signed in?
- **Check**: Open browser console (F12)
- **Check**: No console filters active

### "Cannot publish cursor: no user.uid"
- **Issue**: Not authenticated
- **Fix**: Sign in with Google OAuth

### "PERMISSION_DENIED" error
- **Issue**: Firebase security rules not configured
- **Fix**: Follow `FIREBASE_RTDB_SETUP.md`

### Cursor writes to Firebase but not visible
- **Check**: Both users on same `boardId` (default: 'default')
- **Check**: Console logs show "Cursor update received"
- **Check**: `remoteCursors` array has items
- **Check**: RemoteCursor component rendering (check React DevTools)

### Cursor appears but in wrong position
- **Check**: Both windows have same zoom level
- **Check**: Canvas scale/position is synchronized
- **Note**: Cursor position is in canvas coordinates, not screen coordinates

### Too many logs
- To reduce logging, comment out lines with:
  - `console.log('[...]')`
- Keep `console.warn` and `console.error` for important issues

### Cursors persist after leaving
- **Issue**: Disconnect cleanup not working
- **Check**: Firebase Realtime Database rules allow writes
- **Check**: No errors in console when unmounting
- **Manual fix**: Delete old cursors in Firebase Console → Data tab

## Success Criteria

✅ You should see:
1. Your mouse movement logged to console
2. Cursor data appearing in Firebase Console
3. Other users' cursors appearing as colored circles
4. Cursor labels with user initials
5. Cursors updating smoothly (throttled to 50ms)
6. Cursors disappearing when users leave

## Next Steps

Once cursors are working:
1. Test with 3+ users simultaneously
2. Test with poor network (throttle in DevTools)
3. Test disconnect scenarios (close tab, network off)
4. Consider reducing log verbosity for production
5. Add presence indicators (who's online)
6. Add cursor hover effects

## Performance Notes

- **Throttling**: Cursor updates limited to 50ms (20 updates/sec)
- **Data Size**: Each cursor ~200 bytes
- **Firebase Limits**: 100 concurrent connections on free tier
- **Bandwidth**: ~4KB/sec per active cursor (with throttling)

## Security

Current rules:
- ✅ Only authenticated users can read cursors
- ✅ Users can only write their own cursor
- ✅ Auto-cleanup on disconnect
- ⚠️ No rate limiting (throttle helps)
- ⚠️ No board access control (all auth users see all boards)

For production, consider:
- Board-level permissions
- Rate limiting rules
- Cursor data validation
- Timestamp checks
