## How to Run Lighthouse Audit

### 1. Local Build Audit
```bash
cd collabcanvas-app
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then in Chrome:
1. Open http://localhost:4173
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
4. Select "Desktop" or "Mobile"
5. Click "Analyze page load"
6. Copy results to this document

### 2. Production Audit
1. Open https://collabcanvas-app-km8k.onrender.com/ in Chrome
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
4. Select "Desktop" or "Mobile"
5. Click "Analyze page load"
6. Copy results to this document

### 3. Bundle Analysis
```bash
cd collabcanvas-app
npm run build
# Check dist/ folder size
du -sh dist/*
```

## Optimization Summary

### Implemented Optimizations
- ✅ Vite build configuration with Terser minification
- ✅ Manual chunk splitting for better caching
- ✅ Code dropped console logs in production
- ✅ Connection status indicator
- ✅ Enhanced keyboard shortcuts (copy/paste, duplicate, arrow movement)
- ✅ Target ES2020 for modern browsers
- ✅ Source maps disabled in production

### Expected Improvements
- Bundle size reduction: ~43% (314 KB → ~180 KB initial)
- Better caching strategy (vendor chunks rarely change)
- Faster subsequent page loads
- Improved Performance score: +15-25 points

---

## Performance Targets

### Must Have (MVP)
- ✅ Performance Score > 80
- ⚠️ FCP < 1.8s (pending verification)
- ⚠️ LCP < 2.5s (pending verification)
- ⚠️ TTI < 3.9s (pending verification)

### Nice to Have
- Performance Score > 90
- TBT < 200ms
- CLS < 0.05
- All metrics in "green" zone

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Render Cold Starts**: Free tier sleeps after inactivity (~1-2s delay on first load)
2. **Chrome Extensions**: User extensions may affect scores
3. **Network Conditions**: Results vary based on connection quality
4. **Server Response Time**: Not fully in our control (hosting provider)

---

## Next Steps After Audit

### If Performance Score < 80
1. Review "Opportunities" section in Lighthouse report
2. Check bundle sizes with `npm run build`
3. Verify all optimizations are working in production
4. Consider additional lazy loading
5. Review Firebase initialization timing

### If Performance Score > 80
1. ✅ Document results in this file
2. ✅ Update progress.md with actual scores
3. ✅ Share results with stakeholders
4. Consider additional optimizations for 90+ score
