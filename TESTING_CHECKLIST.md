# Creative Object Generation - Testing Checklist

## 🧪 Manual Testing Guide

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Required)

#### Test 1: Simple Creative Objects
```
Commands:
- "Create a dinosaur"
- "Make a bus"
- "Create a robot"
- "Build a house"
- "Draw a tree"

Expected:
✅ 10-20 shapes created
✅ Object appears at viewport center
✅ Object is recognizable
✅ Success message shows shape count
✅ Time < 1.5 seconds
```

#### Test 2: With Position
```
Commands:
- "Create a dinosaur at 600, 300"
- "Make a pirate ship at 800, 400"

Expected:
✅ Object appears at specified position
✅ All other behavior same as Test 1
```

#### Test 3: With Scale
```
Commands:
- "Create a large robot"
- "Make a small house"

Expected:
✅ Object size varies appropriately
✅ Large objects ~1.5-2x normal size
✅ Small objects ~0.5-0.7x normal size
```

---

### Phase 2: No Impact on Existing Commands (Critical)

#### Test 4: Simple Shapes (Should NOT use createCreativeObject)
```
Commands:
- "Create a red rectangle"
- "Add a blue circle"
- "Make a yellow triangle"

Expected:
✅ Uses createShape tool (check console logs)
✅ Single shape created
✅ Fast response (<500ms)
```

#### Test 5: UI Layouts (Should NOT use createCreativeObject)
```
Commands:
- "Create a login form"
- "Make a nav bar with Home, About, Contact"
- "Build a signup form"

Expected:
✅ Uses createShapesVertically or createShapesHorizontally
✅ Multiple aligned shapes
✅ Not treated as creative object
```

#### Test 6: Grids (Should NOT use createCreativeObject)
```
Commands:
- "Create a 3x3 grid of red squares"
- "Make a 5x2 grid of blue circles"

Expected:
✅ Uses createGrid tool
✅ Identical shapes in rows/columns
✅ Not treated as creative object
```

---

### Phase 3: Edge Cases & Error Handling

#### Test 7: API Failure Simulation
```
Setup:
- Disconnect from internet OR
- Block network in dev tools

Command:
- "Create a car"

Expected:
✅ Fallback plan used (10 abstract shapes)
✅ Success message shown
✅ No error to user
✅ Console shows "Using fallback plan"
```

#### Test 8: Invalid Requests
```
Commands:
- "Create a asdfghjkl" (nonsense object)
- "" (empty string)
- "Make a" (incomplete)

Expected:
✅ Fallback plan used or appropriate error
✅ No crashes
✅ User-friendly error message
```

#### Test 9: Extreme Scales
```
Commands:
- "Create a dinosaur with scale 0.4" (below min)
- "Create a bus with scale 3.0" (above max)

Expected:
✅ Error message about invalid scale
✅ Suggests valid range (0.5-2.0)
```

---

### Phase 4: Quality Verification

#### Test 10: Multiple Objects
```
Commands:
- Create 3 different objects in sequence
- "Create a dinosaur"
- "Make a car at 800, 300"  
- "Create a small house at 400, 500"

Expected:
✅ All objects appear correctly
✅ No overlap issues
✅ Each has 10-20 shapes
✅ Consistent quality
```

#### Test 11: Shape Quality
For each created object, verify:
```
✅ All shapes visible (none off-screen)
✅ Colors appropriate (not all black/white)
✅ Proportions reasonable
✅ Shapes layered correctly (no z-index issues)
✅ Object is recognizable as requested type
```

#### Test 12: Performance
```
Commands:
- Create 5 creative objects in quick succession

Expected:
✅ Each completes in <1.5s
✅ No lag or freezing
✅ Memory usage reasonable
✅ Canvas remains responsive
```

## 🔍 Console Verification

### Check Console Logs For:

#### Successful Creation:
```
✅ 🎨 [Creative Object] Planning "dinosaur" at (X, Y) with scale 1.0
✅ 🎨 [Creative Object] Planning completed in XXXms
✅ 🎨 [Creative Object] Plan validated: NN shapes
✅ 🎨 [Creative Object] Created NN shapes in XXms
```

#### Fallback Usage (should be rare):
```
⚠️ Planning API call failed / Failed to parse plan
⚠️ Using fallback plan...
✅ 🎨 [Creative Object] Created 10 shapes in XXms
```

#### Tool Selection (verify correct tool used):
```
✅ 🔧 [AI] Executing tool: createCreativeObject (for dinosaur)
✅ 🔧 [AI] Executing tool: createShape (for red rectangle)
✅ 🔧 [AI] Executing tool: createGrid (for 3x3 grid)
```

## 🚨 Red Flags (Report if Found)

### Critical Issues:
- ❌ Feature completely fails (no shapes created)
- ❌ App crashes or freezes
- ❌ Shapes created off-screen/invisible
- ❌ Wrong tool used for simple commands
- ❌ Errors shown to user for valid requests

### Moderate Issues:
- ⚠️ Fallback used >10% of time
- ⚠️ Objects not recognizable
- ⚠️ Latency >2 seconds consistently
- ⚠️ Memory leaks over time
- ⚠️ Z-index issues (shapes in wrong order)

### Minor Issues:
- 💡 Colors could be better
- 💡 Proportions slightly off
- 💡 Could use more/fewer shapes
- 💡 Success messages could be clearer

## 🎯 Quick Smoke Test (5 minutes)

If time is limited, run these 5 essential tests:

1. **"Create a dinosaur"** → Should work perfectly
2. **"Create a red rectangle"** → Should use createShape, not createCreativeObject
3. **"Create a login form"** → Should use createShapesVertically
4. **"Create a large robot at 600, 300"** → Should work with position & scale
5. **Disconnect internet → "Create a car"** → Should use fallback gracefully

If all 5 pass → ✅ Basic functionality works
If any fail → ❌ Needs investigation

---

## 📞 Support

If tests fail or questions arise:
1. Check console for error details
2. Review `CODE_REVIEW_FINDINGS.md`
3. Review `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
4. Check implementation in `src/services/aiToolExecutor.js`

**Feature is production-ready** if all critical tests pass! 🚀
